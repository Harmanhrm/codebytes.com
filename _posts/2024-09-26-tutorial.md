# The Complete Guide to Git Version Control

## Introduction to Git

Git is a distributed version control system created by Linus Torvalds in 2005. It revolutionized software development by enabling efficient collaboration, code versioning, and project management. Unlike centralized version control systems, Git gives each developer a complete copy of the project repository, including its entire history.

### Key Features

- **Distributed Architecture**: Every clone is a full backup of all data
- **Branching & Merging**: Powerful support for non-linear development
- **Data Integrity**: SHA-1 hash algorithm ensures content consistency
- **Performance**: Highly optimized for speed and efficiency
- **Flexibility**: Supports various development workflows
- **Open Source**: Free and actively maintained

## Installation Guide
### On Linux

```sh
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install git

On macOS
brew install git
On Windows
Download the installer from the official Git website and follow the installation instructions.

Basic Git Commands
Here are some basic Git commands to get you started:

Initialize a Repository: git init<vscode_annotation details='%5B%7B%22title%22%3A%22hardcoded-credentials%22%2C%22description%22%3A%22Embedding%20credentials%20in%20source%20code%20risks%20unauthorized%20access%22%7D%5D'> </vscode_annotation>- Clone a Repository: git clone <repository-url>
Check Status: git status
Add Changes: git add <file>
Commit Changes: git commit -m "commit message"
Push Changes: git push

Working with Branches
Branches are an essential feature in Git. They allow you to work on different parts of a project simultaneously.

Creating a Branch
git branch <branch-name>

Switching to a Branch
git checkout <branch-name>

Merging a Branch
git checkout main
git merge <branch-name>
