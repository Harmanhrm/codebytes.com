## What is Git?

Git is a distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency. It allows multiple developers to work on a project simultaneously without overwriting each other's changes.

### Key Features of Git

- **Distributed System**: Every developer has a full copy of the project repository, including its history.
- **Branching and Merging**: Git supports powerful branching and merging capabilities, making it easy to manage different lines of development.
- **Lightweight**: Git is fast and efficient, with a small footprint.
- **Data Integrity**: Git ensures the integrity of your data with a robust hashing algorithm.

## Installing Git

To install Git, follow these steps:

### On Linux

```sh
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install git

On macOS
brew install git
On Windows
Download the installer from the official Git website and follow the installation instructions.
